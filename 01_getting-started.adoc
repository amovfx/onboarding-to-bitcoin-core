== Building Bitcoin Core from source

When building Bitcoin Core from source, there are some platform-dependant instructions to follow.

To learn how to build for your platform, visit the Bitcoin Core https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc[bitcoin/doc] directory, and read the file named "build-\*.md", where "*" is the name of your platform.
For windows this is "build-windows.md", for macOS this is "build-osx.md" and for most linux distributions this is "build-unix.md".

There is also a guide by Jon Atack on how to https://jonatack.github.io/articles/how-to-compile-bitcoin-core-and-run-the-tests[compile and test Bitcoin Core].

=== Doxygen documentation

Bitcoin Core uses https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html[Doxygen] to generate developer documentation automatically from its annotated C++ codebase.
Developers can access documentation of the current release of Bitcoin Core online at https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/[doxygen.bitcoincore.org], or alternatively can generate documentation for their current git `HEAD` using `make docs` (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc/developer-notes.md#generating-documentation[Generating Documentation] for more info).

== Bitcoin contributor journeys

Some Contributors have documented their journeys into the space which lets us learn about approaches they found useful, and also any pitfalls and things they found difficult along the way.

== Bitcoin Core and GitHub

Bitcoin Core uses a GitHub-based workflow for development.
The primary function of GitHub in the workflow is to discuss patches and connect them with review comments.

While some other prominent projects, e.g. the Linux kernel, use email to solicit feedback and review, Bitcoin Core has used GitHub for many years.
Initially, Satoshi distributed the code through private emails and hosting source archives at bitcoin.org, and later by hosting on SourceForge (which used SVN but did not at that time have a pull request system like GitHub).
The earliest reviewers submitted changes using patches either through email exchange with Satoshi, or by posting them on the bitcoin forum.

In August 2009, the source code was moved to GitHub by Sirius, and development has remained there and used the GitHub workflows ever since.

=== Organisation & roles

Anyone who contributes code to the codebase is labelled a Contributor by GitHub and also by the community.
As of Version 22.0 of Bitcoin Core, there are ~820 individual Contributors credited with changes.

Some Contributors are also labelled as Members of the https://github.com/orgs/bitcoin/people[Bitcoin Core organisation].
There are currently ~30 Members of the organisation.
There are no defined criteria for becoming a Member of the organisation; persons are usually nominated for addition or removal by current Maintainer/Member/Admin on an ad-hoc basis.
Members are typically frequent Contributors/Reviewers and have good technical knowledge of the codebase.
Members also have some additional permissions over Contributors, such as adding/removing tags on issues and PRs; however, being a Member **does not** permit you to merge PRs into the project.
Members can also be assigned sections of the codebase in which they have specific expertise to be more easily requested for review as Suggested Reviewers by PR authors.

NOTE: It is neither necessary nor desirable to "request reviews" from suggested reviewers in a normal workflow. Doing so without a good reason might be interpreted as being pushy and having the opposite result than intended.

Some Members are also project Maintainers.
There are currently 7 Maintainers on the Bitcoin Core project.
This number is arbitrary and is subject to change as people join and leave the project.
PRs can only be merged into the main project by Maintainers.
While this might give the illusion that Maintainers are in control of the project, the Maintainers' role dictates that they *should not* be unilaterally deciding which PRs get merged and which don't.
Instead, they should be determining the mergability of changes based primarily on the reviews and discussions of other Contributors on the GitHub PR.

Working on that basis, the Maintainers' role becomes largely _janitorial_.
They are simply executing the desires of the community review process, a community which is made up of a decentralized and diverse group of Contributors.

A list of Maintainers and suggested Reviewers can be found in the https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/REVIEWERS[REVIEWERS] document.
As the document states, these are *not* the only people who should be reviewing PRs.
The project needs as many reviews on each PR as possible, ideally from a diverse range of Reviewers.

The objective of the Bitcoin Core Organisation is to represent an entity that is decentralized as much as practically possible on a centralised platform
One where no single Contributor, Member, or Maintainer has unilateral control over what is/isn't merged into the project.
Having multiple Maintainers, Members, Contributors, and Reviewers gives this objective the best chance of being realised.

==== Organisation fail-safes

It is possible for a "rogue PR" to be submitted by a Contributor; however, we rely on systematic and thorough peer review to catch these.
There has recently been https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019490.html[discussion] on the mailing list about purposefully submitting malicious PRs to test the robustness of this review process.

In the event that a Maintainer goes rogue and starts merging controversial code, or conversely, _not_ merging changes that are desired by the community at large, then there are two possible avenues of recourse:

. Have the Lead Maintainer remove the malicious Maintainer
. In the case that the Lead Maintainer themselves is considered to be the rogue agent: fork the project to a new location and continue development there.

In the case that GitHub itself becomes the rogue entity, there have been numerous discussions about how to move away from GitHub, which have been summarized on the devwiki https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/GitHub-alternatives-for-Bitcoin-Core[here].
This summary came in part from discussions on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20227[this] GitHub issue.

=== GitHub workflow

The GitHub side of the Bitcoin Core workflow for Contributors consists primarily of:

* Issues
* PRs
* Reviews
* Comments

Generally, issues are used for two purposes:

. Posting known issues with the software, e.g., bug reports, crash logs
. Soliciting feedback on potential changes without providing associated code, as would be required in a PR.

GitHub provides their own https://guides.github.com/features/issues/[guide] on mastering Issues which is worth reading to understand the feature-set available when working with an issue.

PRs are where Contributors can submit their code against the main codebase and solicit feedback on the concept, the approach taken for the implementation, and the actual implementation itself.

PRs and Issues are often linked to/from one another:

[example]
====
One common workflow is when an Issue is opened to report a bug.
After replicating the issue, a Contributor creates a patch and then opens a PR with their proposed changes.

In this case, the Contributor should, in addition to comments about the patch, reference that the patch fixes the issue.
For a patch which fixes issue 22889 this would be done by writing "fixes #22889" in the PR description or in a commit message.
In this case, the syntax "fixes #issue-number" is caught by GitHub's https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue[pull request linker], which handles the cross-link automatically.
====

Another use-case of Issues is soliciting feedback on ideas that might require _significant_ changes.
This helps free the project from having too many PRs open which aren't ready for review and might waste reviewers' time.
In addition, this workflow can also save Contributors their _own_ valuable time, as an idea might be identified as unlikely to be accepted _before_ the contributor spends their time writing the code for it.

Most code changes to bitcoin are proposed directly as PRs -- there's no need to open an Issue for every idea before implementing it unless it may require significant changes.
Additionally, other Contributors (and would-be Reviewers) will often agree with the approach of a change, but want to "see the implementation" before they can really pass judgement on it.

GitHub is therefore used to help store and track reviews to PRs in a public way.

Comments (inside Issues, PRs, Projects etc.) are where all (GitHub) users can discuss relevant aspects of the item and have history of those discussions preserved for future reference.
Often Contributors having "informal" discussions about changes on e.g. IRC will be advised that they should echo the gist of their conversation as a comment on GitHub, so that the rationale behind changes can be more easily determined in the future.

== Practice
